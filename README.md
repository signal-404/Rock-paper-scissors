#Rock-paper-scissors
🪨 Rock Paper Scissors — My First Python Project

📖 About

This is my first Python project, built while learning from CodeWithHarry’s Complete Python Course (Hindi).
It’s a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player competes against the computer.

The program randomly picks a move for the computer, takes the player’s input, and then compares both to decide who wins.

🧠 What I Learned
	•	Taking user input in Python
	•	Using the random module
	•	Working with dictionaries
	•	Implementing logic using if-elif-else statements
	•	Printing formatted strings using f-strings

⸻

🧩 How It Works
	1.	The player chooses r (rock), p (paper), or s (scissors).
	2.	The computer randomly selects one of the three.
	3.	The program compares both and prints whether you win, lose, or draw.

 💻 Example Output

 Enter your choice: r
You chose rock
Computer chose paper
You lose!
